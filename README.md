Title->Linkedlist-node

Aim->To learn about objrct oriented programming in C++

Theory->Linked list nodes serve as the building blocks for constructing linked lists and related data structures.Linked list nodes are used in various applications, such as implementing dynamic data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues. A linked list is a fundamental data structure used in computer science for storing and managing collections of data. A linked list is composed of individual elements, known as nodes


Algorithm->
Create a class Node with an integer data and a pointer to the next node=>Create four nodes newNode1, newNode2, newNode3, and newNode4 with data values 10, 20, 30, and 40, respectively=>Connect the nodes to form a linked list=>Set newNode1->next to newNode2.AND for other nodes then=>Initialize a head pointer to point to the first node, i.e., head = newNode1=>Print data and addresses of newNode1, newNode2, and newNode3 using individual access=>Use a loop to traverse and print the data and addresses of all nodes in the linked list, starting from head=>While head is not equal to nullptr=>Print head->data, head (self-address), and head->next (next address)=>Update head to point to the next node, i.e., head = head->next=>Properly release the dynamically allocated memory by deleting newNode1, newNode2, newNode3, and newNode4=>Return 0 to indicate successful program execution=>Enc
