Title->Linkedlist-node

Aim->To learn about objrct oriented programming in C++

Theory->Linked list nodes serve as the building blocks for constructing linked lists and related data structures.Linked list nodes are used in various applications, such as implementing dynamic data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues. A linked list is a fundamental data structure used in computer science for storing and managing collections of data. A linked list is composed of individual elements, known as nodes
